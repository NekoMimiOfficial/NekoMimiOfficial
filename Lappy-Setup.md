# Plasma Setup  
first... remove everything... EVERYTHING!!!  
now lets create 2 panels, a 32px panel at the top and a 62px panel at the bottom  
the top panel will contain:  
```
[Application title bar] [Window title] [global menu]        [color picker] [IP address display plus] [Network bandwith DBUS widget] [system tray] [clock] [search]
```
the bottom panel contains the icons only task manager  
add a panel colorizer to the top panel and use the theme provided in the Files folder  
  
on the desktop we set a wallpaper and do nothing else, the desktop remains empty of icons and widgets, the panels are set to be always hidden  

as for the theme:  
- colors: catppuccin.mocha (accent color from wallpaper)  
- application style: kvantum-dark (catppucin-mocha-lavender)  
- plasma style: utterly-round  
- window decorations: breeze (very large shadow, medium outline, hide window title bar for Window Class Name ".*", remove all title bar buttons)  
- icons: tela circle  
- cursors: apple-cursors.  
- system sounds: NekoPanjareh  
- splash screen: Catppucin Mocha  
- login screen: Catppucin Mocha  
- boot splash: BGRT (custom kde neon bgrt)  
  
then you immediately enable wobbly windows at stiffness:6, Drag:80, Move Factor:9  
set window open and close animations to the TV Effect  
make animations speed one notch slower than the default settings  
create a 3x2 grid of virtual desktops  

  
congrats you now have a very kool and awesome theme that requires you to always use the keyboard :3
