# THE INDEKO CODIFICATION PROTOCOL
# An Architectural Manifesto for Sovereign Source Code Orchestration
# Version: 1.3

I. PHILOSOPHICAL ORIENTATION: THE INDEKO ETHER
The Indeko Indent Syntax is a totalizing structural philosophy. It rejects the chaotic "organic" growth of source code in favor of a rigid, geometric purity. In the Indeko Ether, white space is not "nothingness"—it is a structural adhesive. Every character must exist in a state of intentional proximity or calculated isolation. This protocol governs the micro-interaction of symbols to ensure the source code transcends mere instruction and becomes an artifact of architectural excellence.

II. THE DOCTRINE OF VERTICALITY (LINE PROTOCOLS)
A. The Law of Singular Purpose
Every line of code must possess a singular semantic identity. Multiple disparate instructions must never be crowded onto one horizontal axis unless specifically authorized by the "Unitary Collapse" (See Section III-B).

B. The Terminal Semicolon Proximity
The semicolon (;) is the executioner of a statement. It must reside in absolute zero-width contact with the final character of the instruction it terminates. It shall never float; it is the anchor of the line.
- Formalism: executeTask();

III. THE ARCHITECTURAL BLOCK POSTULATE (THE BRACES)
A. The Gate of Initiation (Brace Placement)
The opening brace '{' is a sacred portal to a new scope. It must never share its horizontal plane with the initiating control keyword (if, for, while, void). It must be granted its own dedicated line, perfectly aligned with the start of the declaration.

B. The Unitary-Execution Collapse (The One-Liner)
When a scope encompasses only a single expressive statement, the protocol mandates a "Horizontal Consolidation."
- The opening brace '{' begins on a new line.
- A singular "Breath Space" is inserted.
- The statement is written.
- A singular "Breath Space" is inserted.
- The closing brace '}' terminates the line.
- Example:
  void synchronizeSystems ()
  { processData(); }

C. The Multi-Line Logical Expanse
For complex logic, the internal body must be vertically sequestered. The closing brace '}' must return to the primary axis of alignment on its own dedicated line, serving as a visual floor for the logic above.

IV. THE KINETIC LAWS OF SYMBOLIC GRAVITY
A. The Axiom of Left-Adherent Arithmetic (Math & Assignment)
Operators involved in the transformation or movement of data (+, -, *, /, =) exhibit "Anisotropic Gravity." They are physically pulled toward the left-hand subject.
- Zero-space must exist between the subject and the operator.
- A singular "Buffer Space" must exist between the operator and the object.
- Formalism: totalValue= primaryFactor+ secondaryFactor;

B. The Symmetric Conditional Postulate (Logic & Comparison)
Operators that evaluate the relationship between two entities (==, !=, <, >, &&, ||) must exist in a state of perfect "Spatial Equilibrium." They do not adhere; they float.
- A singular space is required on BOTH the prefix and suffix of the operator.
- Formalism: if (currentStatus == operationalStatus)

V. LEXICAL IDENTITY & NOMENCLATURE
A. The camelCase Nomenclature Directive (thisThingIsNice)
The protocol forbids the use of underscores or mid-word hyphens. All identifiers must utilize the "thisThingIsNice" rhythmic capitalization. The minuscule start signifies humility of data, while subsequent capitalization signifies the emergence of new semantic concepts.

B. The Pre-Parenthetical Void (Function Calls)
An instruction (function) and its arguments are two distinct categories of existence. They must be separated by a singular "Void Space" to prevent lexical collision.
- Formalism: transmitSignal (dataPacket);

VI. THE HIERARCHY OF CIRCULARITY (PARENTHESES)
A. The Recursive Parenthetical Buffer
When high-order logic necessitates the nesting of parentheses, the protocol demands "Ocular Clarity." If two parentheses of identical orientation ( ( or ) ) occur in sequence, a singular space must separate them.
- Formalism: result= ( (variableA+ variableB)/ scaleFactor );

B. The Internal Argument Buffer
While the outside of the parentheses is buffered by a space (See V-B), the interior must be "Flush." No space shall exist between the parenthesis and the argument it contains.
- INDEKO: func (arg);
- VIOLATION: func( arg );

VII. TRANSITIONAL FLOW CONTROL (THE JUNCTURES)
A. The Concatenated Else-Gate
The transition between conditional branches is handled through "Immediate Concatenation." The 'else' keyword must be fused to the same line as the preceding closing brace '}'.
- Formalism: }else

B. The Multi-Branch One-Liner Sequence
If an 'if' and 'else' are both one-liners, the protocol maintains a sleek, jagged-right profile:
- Formalism:
    if (primaryCondition)
    { executeAlpha(); }else
    { executeBeta(); }

VIII. COMMAS AND ENUMERATION
The comma (,) serves as a soft separator. Like the arithmetic axiom, it adheres to the left and buffers the right. There shall be no space before a comma, and exactly one space after.
- Formalism: listItems (itemA, itemB, itemC);
