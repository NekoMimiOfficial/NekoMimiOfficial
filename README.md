✿I'm @NekoMimiOfficial but call me neko!

❀I'm your average hobbyist who is very into computers and networking  
My main programming languages are :  
•Python (it just works)  
•C++ (pain)  
•Full stack web-dev (HTML CSS PHP JS)  
•Bash scripts (useful and fast)  

✿I love the PS Vita™ and I'd love to support it as much as I can thus I'll make most of projects aimed towards it  
You can find most of my work on @FroscoInnovativeTechnologies  

❀Currently privately developing a 32bit only Linux distro based on debian buster including apps that I compile to give a more recent version and a custom kernel  
It's called NekOS (pronounced nekos) ฅ⁠^⁠•⁠ﻌ⁠•⁠^⁠ฅ
