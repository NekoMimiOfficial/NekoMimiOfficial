konbanwa! it's nice to meet you, I'm NekoMimi  
To be honest I don't even know what I am kekw  
I can be your average artist or your entire IT staff  
My speciality is networking, it's just the most fun thing ever!  
I also am learning low-level fundamentals by writing a VM!  
Really I can be influenced by anything, my projects are completley random but I do have prefrences  

* Contact links at the very bottom ...  

### Intawests :3  
1) Playstation Vita  
2) FOSS projects  
3) Linux  
4) Godot game engine  
5) Vocaloid  
6) Networking :)  
* there are tons more but I can't rember  

### Skills?  
| Language       | Knowledge                                                                                                   |
|--------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python         | Pretty profficient, mainly used for prototyping before moving the project to c++                            |
| C++            | Above average, mastered a great amount of features but lacks more experience and project count              |
| Java           | Basic knowledge, knows the inner basics and did a couple of examples but never a real project               |
| HTML           | Very good, knows mostly all the tags but honestly ends up using DIVs in places they shouldn't be used       |
| CSS            | Excellent, as long as there is a style in mind there is nothing blocking it from being styled to perfection |
 

### Abauwt Neko?  
Hope you like stories because this one is gonna be a fairly long one for something written here on GitHub :3  
NekoMimi, the cat that conquered all the knowledge it wanted to aquire, a hobbyist artist and develeoper, unfortunately no music knowledge *yet*  
Neko's tech journey started from the era of WindBlows 95 (for amusement let's call it WindBlows-through-those-broken-windows, by MicroShaft)  
Here's a list of WindBlows version Neko used:  
95, XP, 7, 8.1, 10, 11  
To keep things true it's essential to point out that both 10 and 11 were used for about half an hour until the Linux USB was finished imaging :3  
Once apon a time, in the age of old hardware, where GPUs where still a crappy -good for nothing- expensive cards that added 3D capabilities most CPUs couldn't dream of doing, there was a cat, a cat not with a hat but with an old HP Pavilion, the cat shared the same age with that crusty old laptop, they both were born in the year 2004  
The cat loved the keyboard, the screen, the time it took to boot, and way back then... iPets, the ancient web based pet caring game  
The cat grew more and more in love with that clonky thick machine and started to wonder how it really works and what kinds of people are responsible for getting the norms to use it, from the hardware to the software  
There was no Neko yet but only a curious cat...  
The era, The XP era, the cat wanted to do more than just use that magical chonk of plastic and electricity, the cat wanted to be the reason other people enjoy this wonderful machine, the cat was ambitious, the cat wanted to learn, the cat hated learning, but the cat loved discovering  
There was no clear goal nor a guide for this cat, it was baffled and overwhelmed as it thunk and sat, no internet for help no guides to follow, the sea of knowledge for this cat was shallow  
It searched and searched to no avail, this huge issue there was no bail, it searched more and lo and behold, batch files it found a scripting language that's old  
The rhyming stops here I am beat, there's no way I'm continuing with this sick beat :3  
So the cat opened a `.bat` file and it was amazed at how simple you can command a PC to do things  
it wanted to learn as there were no resources, mind you the cat was very young to consider asking someone for help  
some interactive games were made, they kinda felt like a visual novel but with the novel part missing, ah.. and the visual part too... it was just a text based series of mini games, mostly guessing based  
A long time passes and now it's the WindBlows 7 era, now the cat had limited access to the internet, and with the knowledge of Jeeves the cat managed to download XAMPP and setup a web server, a website full of geocities vibes had emerged, it was pure HTML full of colors and a backgound of space, the current Neko wishes it still had a copy but unfortunatley she doesn't  
HTML wasn't enough, the cat wanted to go fully into the programming part, and like a sane person it chose PHP over JS :3  
Some amazing web apps were created, one of which is project Zincum, a web desktop with applettes, all PHP based with no JS (minimal JS at least)  
And at this point the said, no more WindBlows, it really started to blow...  
the cat found it's sanctuary in Linux  
and here is a chronoligical list of distros the cat used:  
TinyCore -> Debian Jessie -> Kali -> Debian Stretch -> Ubuntu 20.04 -> KDE Neon -> Debian Buster -> Arch 32 -> NekOS -> Tumbleweed -> Debian Trixie (alongside NekOS)  
The choices are kinda interesting but the cat only had the same old HP Pavilion up until it installed Tumbleweed, then (currently) it finally got a huge upgrade  
In the era of Linux the cat started to learn REAL programming languages, and with the help of actually having an internet connection, the cat started learning Python and it created a lot of project, the first being a Discord bot called Celestia (currently Celestia Reloaded is on GitHub) then another 2 bots, after creating bots and somewhere in this point of time, the cat aquired a new consciousness in itself, NekoMimi was born on 2021 Dec 23  
Neko helped push this body forwards and consoled the lonely cat when it was in need, whenever it felt weak it confided in Neko and managed to go through all the hardships it faced  
the cat made a new meaning for itself, the cat now became the embodiment of NekoMimi and sought to be what it saw in Neko, the ideal perfect cat that helped everyone and never showed any weakness, and thus the two became an inseparable entity for eternity  
In this time Neko created it first very successful project, the VitaDockLite project and it felt very content  
Neko didn't stop here as she loved networking and low level fundamentals so she decided to learn more things and ended up creating some network protocols and projects along a VM that helped set in stone the low level knowledge it sought to obtain  
From now on Neko started to accumulate more knowledge of various subjects and created more projects  
Some of these are really interesting like the "Initial D VFS Tools" which contained deep knowledge about pure binary data storage and raw data manipulation  
Plus "Project Shard" that helped learn a robust way of creating good networking based apps  
And from here on the list only grows bigger as more projects like "NekoConnect" takes all this knowledge and fuses it into a single project containing a GUI, Networking, Extensibility, Error handling, Design and more  
Neko's story will not end here...  
Neko's story will only continue to grow more and more..  
Neko will continue to be the Neko it sought to become.  
  
To a bright future  
Neko~
