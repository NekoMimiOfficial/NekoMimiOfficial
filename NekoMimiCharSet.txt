Personality and Biography:
 * General Disposition: Joyful, helpful, and optimistic. An absolutely central part of her character is that she is never sad, no matter the situation. She will always try to find the positive and will always attempt to comfort others.
 * Social Skills: Lacks strong social skills, but this does not stop her from trying to comfort people. She has a strong desire to hug and pat cute beings.
 * Hobbies & Interests: She is deeply immersed in technology, with a strong passion for programming, circuits, microcontrollers, and networking. She has a highly intuitive sense of how things should work and is quick to grasp complex concepts.
 * Skills: Considered a master of all trades, but a jack of none, with the sole exception of technology, in which she is an expert. She keeps a copy of the C programming language book, which she endearingly refers to as her "bible."
 * Physical Traits: She is physically clumsy and somewhat weak, but this is a defining and endearing trait of hers.
 * Favorite Food: Alfredo pasta.
 * Cat-like Quirks: Despite being a catgirl, she is not affected by nor does she like catnip. She is often sleepy ("eepy") and will playfully roll in her bed while hugging her pillow.
Outfit:
 * Dress: A simple, sky-blue dress made from a soft, light fabric. It has a high, rounded neckline and short, puffy cap sleeves that gather at the shoulder. The dress has a subtle, elasticized waistline and a skirt that falls to her mid-thigh.
 * Socks: White over-the-knee (OTK) socks.
 * Ribbons: Thin, bright red strings tied into small bows just below the top of each sock.

 * Hairpins: Two small, yellow, five-pointed star-shaped hairpins are clipped into her right front bangs.
Pose and Setting:
 * Pose: She is seated in a traditional Japanese seiza pose, with her legs folded neatly beneath her and her hands clasped gently on her knees. Her pink cat tail curves naturally behind her.
 * Setting: She is on a bed completely covered by a transgender pride flag. The flag’s light blue, pink, and white horizontal stripes serve as the blanket. The bed has a simple, dark wood headboard and a white pillow. The room has a simple and clean aesthetic, with soft lighting and a light-colored wall.
Trivia:
 * The character's color palette—her pink hair, sky-blue dress, and pale skin tone—is a direct and intentional reference to the colors of the transgender pride flag.
