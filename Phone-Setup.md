# Setup  
kk i'll try to add some save files to the repo  
  
this doesnt go in any specific order but it includes the steps needed  
most app data is backed up and restored via root/luckypatcher  
other apps that export saves can be imported (private)  
  
after initial lawnchair setup, set the recents provider using QS  
set the system font to Google Sans/Product Sans and keep lawnchair on Inter font  
set lockscreen to Lumine Live-Wallpaper and the homescreen to the Lumine regular Wallpaper  
set the DPI to 400  
set the font size to the smallest  
enable gesture navigation  
enable auto dark mode  
edit lockscreen to show only the face widget (clock) and keep it as close to the google pixel style with a huge clock  
if possible set battery icon to circle  
set notification icons to show only the notification count in notification bar  
  
and now you should have a UI that is Neko-Certified :3  
  
now to the fun part of setting up every app and importing the music library (just get every Deco*27 and YOASOBI song along some others :3)  
assuming you've setup goog accounts most goog apps should be good to go  
pair KDE connect devices  
enable glide typing on gboard  
import 2FA keys  
sign in to other apps idk lol  
  
aaaaa.. it should be done..  
and now i can try my luck with some GSIs :3
